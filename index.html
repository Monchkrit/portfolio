				<p class="bio">
				My first programming experience was with my best friend Mario when I was 8 years old. His dad bought him a Timex Sinclair 1000, and we spent the summer programming it to bounce balls and interact through text input/output. I gained further programming experience when I received a Commodore Vic 20 for Christmas when I was 11. I have a masters degree in information systems and 15 years of professional experience as a desktop support technician and systems administration. I spent the last few years teaching 5th grade as a full time general education teacher. During my teaching career I have completed the teacher credential training program called CalSTATE TEACH. I became vegan on July 20, 2018. I run and do other kinds of exercise several times per week. I am married with three kids and four grand kids.
